# FooTable V3 #

This is a complete re-write of the plugin. There is no upgrade path from V2 to V3 at present as the options and the way the code is written are inherently different. Please check out the full documentation for V3 found in the docs folder or by viewing it [online here](http://fooplugins.github.io/FooTable/).

# Changelog #

### 3.1.1

- Added the `breakpoint` class to the table when columns are hidden.
- Added an internal key used as part of the storage keys generated by the state component. Can be changed if an update breaks backwards compatibility.
- Added the `hidden` option that can be used for filters. When set to true the filter is always applied to the table, can not be cleared unless removed using the `FooTable.Filtering#removeFilter()` method and they will not effect the default UI search/clear buttons.
- Updated some utility functions with additional parameter checking to avoid unhandled errors under certain scenarios.
- Updated the `FooTable.Filtering#addFilter()` method to expose the last three parameters of the `FooTable.Filter` constructor; ignoreCase, connectors and space.
- Fixed an issue when reinitializing the plugin for a second time on a table after it's DOM had been modified by a 3rd party.
- Fixed an issue where the `FooTable.Filtering#draw()` method was not setting the button to the clear icon if the filter supplied was not the default.
- Fixed state component clearing filters supplied through options if the state value was an empty array.
- Fixed an issue with the incorrect sort icon appearing if a column was set to just `sorted=true` without supplying a direction.

----------

### 3.1.0

- Added a new state component that handles the page number, sorted column and any filters applied across sessions.
- Added in the ability to toggle the visibility of the various editing component buttons.
- Added in a new "view" button to the editing component.
- Added in `FooTable.Rows#expand()` and `FooTable.Rows#collapse()` methods to toggle all visible rows.
- Added in a new `FooTable.getRow()` utility method to retrieve the current `FooTable.Row` object given a `TR` element or any of its' children.
- Fixed an issue when reinitializing the plugin by doing some additional cleanup in the destroy methods for columns, rows and sorting.
- Fixed an issue with filtering not applying correctly when filters were supplied through the options.
- Fixed base `FooTable.Component` method signatures.
- Updated the `FooTable.Row#val()` method to merge supplied data instead of replacing it entirely.
- Updated the `FooTable.getFnPointer()` method to handle dot notation names.
- Updated the requirement checks for columns so having at least one `data-breakpoints` attribute is no longer required.
- Updated the `FooTable.Filtering#filter()` method to only apply all filters in the `FooTable.Filtering#filters`.
- Removed the `FooTable.Table#applyFilter()` and `FooTable.Table#removeFilter()` methods.
- Removed the `FooTable.components.core` and `FooTable.components.internal` objects.

**NOTE**

As of version 3.1.0 there are some backwards compatibility issues if you have done customizations like those seen in the [custom dropdown filter](http://fooplugins.github.io/FooTable/docs/examples/advanced/filter-dropdown.html) example using the 3.0.x versions. The examples have been updated with the changes however the issues are listed below.

1. The `FooTable.Filtering#filter()` method no longer accepts any arguments and is used purely to apply all filters found in the `FooTable.Filtering#filters` array.
2. Due to #1 above to apply a new search filter it must now be done using the `FooTable.Filtering#addFilter(name, query, columns)` method using a name of "search".
3. The internal, core and custom component arrays that existed within the `FooTable.Table#components` object have been removed. All components are now loaded into a single array.
4. When registering a component you now only need to use `FooTable.components.register()` method instead of having to decide between `FooTable.components.register()`, `FooTable.components.core.register()` and `FooTable.components.internal.register()` due to #3 above.
